# Star-Citizen-Launcher
Launcher for Star Citizen with auto control mapping backup and shader delete

First attempt at easy to use GUI for backing up Star Citizen control mappings simultaneously for live and PTU.  Live mappings take precedence and are copied and backed up all at once.  Should be compatible for new file path in Star Citizen 3.13 

Installation steps:
1 extract PXPStarCitizenEasyLaunch.zip to a folder
2 Use "Star Citizen Easy Launcher.exe" to launch SC each time you 

App will allow you select your RSI Launcher and StarCitizen root folders and then automatically backs up your control mapping files, Deletes shaders, and launches the RSI Launcher.exe program and closes itself.
