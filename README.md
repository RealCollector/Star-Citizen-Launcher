# Star-Citizen-Launcher
Launcher for Star Citizen with auto control mapping backup and shader delete

First attempt at easy to use GUI for backing up Star Citizen control mappings simultaneously for live and PTU.  Live mappings take precedence and are copied and backed up all at once.  Should be compatible for new file path in Star Citizen 3.13 

Installation steps:
1 Create a folder for the app
2 Copy all the app files into the folder
3 Run "Star Citizen Easy Launcher.exe"

App will allow you select your launcher and game root folders and then automatically backs up your control mapping files, Deletes shaders, and launches the RSI Launcher.exe program and closes itself.
